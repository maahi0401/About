        "* **Situation:** Briefly describe the data problem.\n",
        "* **Task:** Identify which feature engineering/reduction technique is needed.\n",
        "* **Action:** Write the code and explain your parameter choices (e.g., why `StandardScaler`?).\n",
        "* **Result:** Interpret the output (e.g., \"This reduced our feature space by 60% while retaining 95% variance\").\n",

        "**Scenario:** You've built a t-SNE visualization that shows perfect class separation. Your manager asks you to put this t-SNE transformation into the real-time production pipeline for new incoming data.\n",
        "* **Problem:** Explain why this is or isn't possible. Propose an alternative architecture (e.g., using PCA or a small Autoencoder).\n",
